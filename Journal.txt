Commit #1:
With this section I have added the navbar, title of the tab, title of the document,
  and added the words for the About section. The plan for this is to later add the
  photo above the H2 heading (Hell there...). I had some problems with the navbar 
  because that was always a trouble that I had but I was able to get it properly
  designed (or at least so I think so far).
