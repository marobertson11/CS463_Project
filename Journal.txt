Commit #1:
With this section I have added the navbar, title of the tab, title of the document,
and added the words for the About section. The plan for this is to later add the
photo above the H2 heading (Hello there...). I had some problems with the navbar 
because that was always a trouble that I had but I was able to get it properly
designed (or at least so I think so far).

Commit #2:
This commit has the section that has the information concerning the resume/previous
Work. The breakdown of this is that it has my educations: specifically the degree
I am working on and my education with the navy. One problem that I will be 
encountering is how I am going to have to format the designs of these. I think I
will be taking two of the sections, the edcuation section known as JCAC (abbreviated)
and the work section may be a drop down section. That way it doesn't take up too 
much space even though it will have some lines either way. With the education sections
I may be putting them side by side, two different columns so that they stay in the same
section. The formatting sections will be done in later commits.

Commit #3:
This commit adds the section that holds the project infromation. The plan was originally
to use grid aspects to seperate the two projects as 2 columns. So far this has not 
worked as of yet, but the project is still going. The main point of this concern is to 
get the information onto the document and later the formatting will be done. Most 
likely in commit #6? I was having a little bit of problems with seperating the css styles 
for the links compared to the navbar links. This led me to having to re-word some of 
the previous sections.
