Commit #1:
With this section I have added the navbar, title of the tab, title of the document,
and added the words for the About section. The plan for this is to later add the
photo above the H2 heading (Hell there...). I had some problems with the navbar 
because that was always a trouble that I had but I was able to get it properly
designed (or at least so I think so far).

Commit #2:
This commit has the section that has the information concerning the resume/previous
Work. The breakdown of this is that it has my educations: specifically the degree
I am working on and my education with the navy. One problem that I will be 
encountering is how I am going to have to format the designs of these. I think I
will be taking two of the sections, the edcuation section known as JCAC (abbreviated)
and the work section may be a drop down section. That way it doesn't take up too 
much space even though it will have some lines either way. With the education sections
I may be putting them side by side, two different columns so that they stay in the same
section. The formatting sections will be done in later commits.
