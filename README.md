# CS463_Project
This is my webpage project. 
There is no need to be able to run it, simply click on this url displayed below and it will take you to the website
For the languages that I used for this it would be html, css, and then JavaScript. 
All of the resources that I used were based on the teachings of Caterina Paun and past teachings.
