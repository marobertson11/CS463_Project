            I am an undergrad student pursing my bachelor's degree in Computer
            Science through the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer
            Science program at Portland State University in Oregon. Before
            starting my bachelor's degree, I had previous experience with game
            design and had been education in some cyber security through the
            military and planned on utilizing this education to further my
            career. Once I started my degree, I gained a better handle on both
            other languages and how to think in different perspectives.

              Data Pipeline</a
            >
            <p>
              This data pipeline reads data provided from TriMet C-TRAN. Once
              the data is gathered, it is then filtered as it sends it through a
              buffer called Apache Kafka. Once the data has gone through the
              buffer, it is then sent to a PostgreSQL table. Being in a
              PostgreSQL table allows for the user to create exportable data
              reports. These files allow for data maps to be made that represent
              the query. This project uses Python, Linux bash scripts, Apache
              Kafka, PostgreSQL, and MapboxGL.

              Walktober is a yearly fitness challenge at PSU and this project is
              to design a software platform for it. The platform is modern,
              responsive, improved design and analytics and simplified
              configuration. This project uses React Typescript, Ionic
              Framework, and Javascript
